description:
    - Fetches details about one or multiple SecurityAssessment resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    - Gets a list of security assessments.
    - The ListSecurityAssessments operation returns only the assessments in the specified `compartmentId`.
      The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.
    - The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
      requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
      or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
      Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
      `compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.
    - The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListSecurityAssessments on the
      `compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
      To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
      set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.
    - If I(security_assessment_id) is specified, the details of a single SecurityAssessment will be returned.
