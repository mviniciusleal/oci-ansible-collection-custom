    - Perform actions on a SecurityAssessment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    - "For I(action=change_compartment), moves the specified saved security assessment or future scheduled assessments into a different compartment.
      To start, call first the operation ListSecurityAssessments with filters \\"type = save_schedule\\". This returns the scheduleAssessmentId. Then, call this
      changeCompartment with the scheduleAssessmentId.
      The existing saved security assessments created due to the schedule are not moved. However, all new saves will be associated with the new compartment."
    - For I(action=set_security_assessment_baseline), sets the saved security assessment as the baseline in the compartment where the the specified assessment
      resides. The security assessment needs to be of type 'SAVED'.
    - For I(action=unset_security_assessment_baseline), removes the baseline setting for the saved security assessment. The saved security assessment is no
      longer considered a baseline.
      Sets the if-match parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.
