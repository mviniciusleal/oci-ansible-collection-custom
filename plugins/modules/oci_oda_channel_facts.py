    - Fetches details about one or multiple Channel resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    - Returns a page of Channels that belong to the specified Digital Assistant instance.
    - If the `opc-next-page` header appears in the response, then
      there are more items to retrieve. To get the next page in the subsequent
      GET request, include the header's value as the `page` query parameter.
    - If I(channel_id) is specified, the details of a single Channel will be returned.
